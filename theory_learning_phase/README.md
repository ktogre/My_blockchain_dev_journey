# Blockchain Development — Theory Phase

This folder documents my Blockchain Development "Theory Phase" from (June 16 – July 19, 2025).  
This daily logs are not summaries but rather a way to document the activities or theory concept learned daily on blockchain fundamentals(think of it as a journal). It is way of keeping track of my progress and I hope one day, I will come to this years down the line to see how far I have come.
