#### DAILY LEARNING LOG (DAY 17) BLOCKCHAIN-DEV  
Watch a video on eth.build today like promised yesterday and that leads me to the Ethereum website to learn about transactions, blocks and EVM states on the Ethereum network.  
There's so much to be done.  
Exciting times ahead.  
Will do a review of learned concepts tomorrow to solidify my understanding.
