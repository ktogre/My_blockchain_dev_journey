#### DAILY LEARNING LOG (DAY 22) BLOCKCHAIN-DEV  
â€¢ Casper FFG (Friendly Finality Gadget) and Sharding (teamwork) in Ethereum 2.0.  
That's what I learned today and I can't say I have fully understood it, I'm just aware of it.  
Will have to read further for deep understanding.  
**Key Takeaway:**  
"Casper FFG = the system that ensures blocks are final, trusted, and irreversible."
