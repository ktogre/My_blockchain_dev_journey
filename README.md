# Blockchain Development Journey

This repository documents my journey into blockchain development, broken into three structured phases:

## 1. Theory Phase
A collection of my daily learning logs on the foundational topics in blockchain development.
check out theory phase here: [Theory phase](./theory_learning_phase/)


## 2. Practical Phase (RemixIDE)
This is where the actual codes and smart contracts to are written but on web based IDE(`REMIX`).
check it out here: [Remix IDE Based contracts](./practical_phase_RemixIDE/contracts)


## 3. Practical Phase (LocalSetup)
This phase continues my hands-on smart contract practice, but now in a **local development environment** using `Foundry` or any other tools as the need may arise. 
It is not full-scale development (no UI or complete dApps), that will come in a separate repository.

This repo will evolve as my knowledge deepens. Itâ€™s not just for reference, but also for tracking growth and sharing with others curious about the same path.
