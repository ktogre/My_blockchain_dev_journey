# Blockchain Development Journey

This repository documents my journey into blockchain development, broken into two structured phases:

## 1. Theory Phase (The phase I am currently in)
A collection of my daily learning logs on the foundational topics in blockchain development.

## 2. Practical Phase
Actual code projects and hands-on implementations using different blockchain tools, frameworks, and smart contract languages.

At this, I will build projects, deploy smart contracts as well as other exiting thing this field has to offer.


This repo will evolve as my knowledge deepens. Itâ€™s not just for reference, but also for tracking growth and sharing with others curious about the same path.

# I hope you enjoy this as much I do
