# Blockchain Development Journey

This repository documents my journey into blockchain development, broken into two structured phases:

## 1. Theory Phase (The phase I am currently in)
A collection of my daily learning logs on the foundational topics in blockchain development.
check out theory phase here: [Theory phase](./theory-phase/)

## 2. Practical Phase 
MY playground as i like to call it, is where the actual codes and smart contracts to sharpen my skills are written.
check practical phase here: [Practical phase projects](./practical-phase/contracts/)

At this, I will build projects, deploy smart contracts as well as other exiting thing this field has to offer.


This repo will evolve as my knowledge deepens. Itâ€™s not just for reference, but also for tracking growth and sharing with others curious about the same path.

# I hope you enjoy this as much I do
