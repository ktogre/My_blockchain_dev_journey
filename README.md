# Blockchain Development Journey

This repository documents my journey into blockchain development, broken into two structured phases:

## 1. Theory Phase
A collection of my daily learning logs on the foundational topics in blockchain development.
check out theory phase here: [Theory phase](./theory_learning_phase/)

## 2. Practical Phase (The phase I am currently in)
MY playground as i like to call it, is where the actual codes and smart contracts to sharpen my skills are written.
check practical phase here: [Practical phase projects](./practical_learning_phase/contracts)

This repo will evolve as my knowledge deepens. Itâ€™s not just for reference, but also for tracking growth and sharing with others curious about the same path.
