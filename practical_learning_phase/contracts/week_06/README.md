# Weekly Learning Log

This week, I focused on **Cyfrin Updraft** and coding along with smart contracts.  
Although I can’t share the full code here, below are the key concepts I learned:

---

## Solidity Concepts
- **Function Overriding**  
  - Using the `override` and `virtual` keywords.  

- **Contract Imports**  
  - Importing contracts via **npm**, **GitHub**, or directly on **Remix IDE**.  

- **Inheritance**  
  - Extending contracts to reuse and build on existing logic.  

- **Libraries**  
  - Writing and using my own libraries for modular and reusable code.  

- **Withdrawal Methods**  
  - Studied different approaches:  
    - `send`  
    - `transfer`  
    - `call`

## Oracles (Chainlink)
- **Data Feeds** – Getting decentralized price data.  
- **VRF (Verifiable Randomness)** – Secure random number generation.  
- **Automation** – Formerly "Keepers," automating smart contract functions.  
- **Functions** – External computation via Chainlink Functions.

## Milestone
**Great NEWS:** I have completed the **Cyfrin Updraft course on Solidity Fundamentals**!

That's all for this week.
