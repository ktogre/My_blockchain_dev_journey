# Solidity Practice Playground

This repository tracks my hands-on progress as I learn and practice writing smart contracts using Remix IDE.

> NOTE: This repo does not use a full local development environment (like Hardhat or Foundry) yet as my skill is yet to reach that level(I mean common, I am justing starting this).  
> All contracts are written, compiled, and tested directly in [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

---

-  Solidity smart contracts are updated weekly.
-  No deployment scripts or testing framework (yet)
-  No node_modules, build system, or Hardhat setup

## How to Run These Contracts

> These contracts are intended to be run in Remix IDE.

1. Visit [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)
2. Create a new file and paste in any of the .sol contracts from this repo
3. Use the Solidity Compiler tab to compile
4. Use the Deploy & Run Transactions tab to test the contract
