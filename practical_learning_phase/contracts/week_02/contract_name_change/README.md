### Summary  
Built a `ChangeContractName` contract that allows the owner to reset the contract's name. Implemented event logging for name changes, Ether reception (`receive()`), and fallback calls (`fallback()`). Reinforced the use of `onlyOwner` modifier and best practices for emitting events to track important state changes and unexpected interactions.

Todayâ€™s contract: [change_contract_name](./change_contract_name.sol)
