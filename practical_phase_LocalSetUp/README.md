## 3. Practical Phase (LocalSetup)

This phase continues my hands-on smart contract practice, but now in a **local development environment** using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) or any other tools as the need may arise. 
It is not full-scale development (no UI or complete dApps), that will come in a separate repository.  


The contracts here will not be **time-driven** (weekly basis) like the RemixIDE phase, but **event-driven** (built around learning different concepts and implementing them as the need arises).


The focus here is writing **smarter contracts than in the RemixIDE phase**, with:
- Proper project setup (tests, scripts, configs).  
- Cleaner and more modular Solidity code.  
- Iterative growth of contracts through versions (V1 → V2 → V3).


Example structure:
V1.sol --> Core basics: minimum working contract with main functionality only.  
V2.sol --> Security + access controls: add validations, permissions, and data integrity checks.  
V3.sol --> Interaction + advanced features: add events, multi-user functions, and extended logic.
