# Week 4 Recap (Day 22–27)

## Concepts Covered

- Ethereum 2.0:
  - Casper FFG (finality mechanism)
  - Sharding (horizontal scalability)
- Awareness of complexity in Ethereum’s transition
- Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and the Byzantine Generals Problem
- Ethereum validator system:
  - Inactivity leaks
  - Weak subjectivity points
  - Slots and Epochs
- EVM internals:
  - Storage types (storage, transient, memory, stack)
  - Calldata and returndata
  - Immutable contract code on-chain
- ERC token standards:
  - ERC-20: Fungible
  - ERC-721: Non-fungible
- Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-256): deterministic, pre-image resistance, avalanche effect
- Ethereum finality mechanics: Supermajority links, aggregators, inclusion delays
