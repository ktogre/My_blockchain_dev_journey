### DAILY LEARNING LOG (DAY 35) â€” BLOCKCHAIN-DEV  
**"Solidity"**

I used today to familiarize myself with Solidity development environment.  

Explored Remix IDE: Files explorer, Compiler tab, and Deployment section.  
But...  
What wasted my time today was trying to set up my VS Code to compile and deploy smart contracts.  
Compiling I was able to do, but deploying didn't work out.  
(Note: I didn't use the default contract but just tried to deploy mine.)

I realized I need to understand how to write scripts,  
so I will focus on using Remix IDE for the time being.
