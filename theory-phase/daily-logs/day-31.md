### DAILY LEARNING LOG (DAY 31) â€” BLOCKCHAIN-DEV
**Today's activities:**  
Learned and simulated transactions, meta transactions, and smart contracts on eth.build.  
And that brings an end to eth.build.  

For 31 days now, I have been learning fundamentals just to be sure and fresh with knowledge before entering "Solidity".  
I'll do a thorough 3-day review again.
