### • Summary  
The first part of this week in a nutshell:  
I learned the basic structure of a smart contract, the version declarations (pragma), and the License usage (`// SPDX...`).  
• Used msg.sender to access caller identity, and msg.value to track the value of ETH sent in a contract.  
• Deployed contracts with constructor and handled funds using payable, transfer, and basic validation keywords like require(), revert(), and assert() for security.
