# My developer playground  
  
Welcome to my playground  
  
This repository tracks my hands-on progress as I go from beginner to a market-ready blockchain developer. Every contract here is a step toward mastering the Ethereum ecosystem, smart contract architecture, dApps, and Web3 protocols.

You can view all contracts here: [View all contracts](./contracts/)
